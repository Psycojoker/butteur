# Introduction

Butteur is a preprocessor to write beamers slides more easily by allowing you to use a more concise syntax. It was also an excuse for me to learn lex/yacc

# Installation

In a virtualenv or as root:

    pip install butteur

You'll need to have the command "pdflatex" available.

# Usage

    butteur file.butt

# Example

    theme Berlin
    title the title of the document
    author Myself master of the world

    slide
        this is the first line
        you don't need to put a blank line between 2 lines
        you can put \emph{raw latex here}

    slide this slide has a title
        and some content

# Result in .tex
